# Project 3: Interactive Visualization
## Arctic Sky Seasonal Changes

### Research Question
**How does the sky in the Arctic change through the seasons?**

The Arctic experiences extreme seasonal variations: 23 hours of daylight in summer and 4-20 hours of darkness in winter. We visualize these dramatic changes through satellite imagery color composites.

### Dataset
**NASA MODIS (MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer)**
- Daily global satellite imagery with multi-spectral bands
- Band 1 (Red), Band 2 (NIR), Band 3 (Blue) for color composite visualization
- 20+ years of temporal coverage
- Accessible via NASA Worldview/GIBS API

### Exploratory Visualizations
